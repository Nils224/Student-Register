# Student-Register

**This node application allows you to generate a lesson specifying the teacher and mark the attendance of the students.**

**A student can be generated by passing their name into the Student class and can be stored as an array for the students attending that lesson.**

class Student{

    constructor(name, late, onTime, absent){
        
        if (!name){
            throw new Error('Student name needs to be specified');
        }else {
            this.name = name;
            this.late = false;
            this.onTime = false;
            this.absent = true;
        };
    };
};

module.exports = Student;


const Student = require('./student');

const student1 = new Student('Nilesh');
const student2 = new Student('Nath');
const student3 = new Student('Bilaal');
const student4 = new Student('Tom');

const studentsAttending = [
    student1,
    student2,
    student3,
    student4
];

**A teacher can be generated by passing in the teacher's name.**
class Teacher{

    constructor(subject, name){
        if (!subject || !name){
            throw new Error('Please state the subject or the name of the teacher');
        }else {
            this.subject = subject;
            this.name = name;
        }
    };
};

module.exports = Teacher;


const Teacher = require('./teacher');

const teacher = new Teacher('Maths', 'Billy');

**A lesson can be generated by passing in the teacher and the subject taught.**

const mathsLesson = new Lesson(teacher, studentsAttending);

**An error will be displayed if any of these parameters are not entered.**

**Each student will be automatically be absent. You can then mark each student on time or late by the following methods.**

mathsLesson.markOnTime([student1,student3]);
mathsLesson.markLate([student2]);
mathsLesson.outputSummary();

**The application will display the lesson subject and teacher's name along with the attendance of the students. This can be call by running __node index.js__.**
